description: "One piece of the puzzle is in its place, it proofs to myself that with little steps, focus and dedication I can reach goals that seemed far of. This is very obvious for sports where I trained and got to measure progress. Still it is also true for my role in Business and in Personal life. The difficult thing is to understand how to train and measure progress as it's kind of intangible.  Setting Goals, studying and getting feedback are key in this process and I'll continue to work on this."
